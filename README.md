- AI-generated TL;DR for you to quickly pick up target papers.
- Affiliations of the paper are resolved and presented.
- Links of PDF and code implementation (if any) presented in the e-mail.
- List of papers sorted by relevance with your recent research interest.
- Fast deployment via fork this repo and set environment variables in the Github Action Page.
- Support LLM API for generating TL;DR of papers.
- Ignore unwanted Zotero papers using a list of glob patterns.

## 🚀 Usage
### Quick Start
1. Fork (and star😘) this repo.
![fork](./assets/fork.png)

2. Set Github Action environment variables.
![secrets](./assets/secrets.png)

Below are all the secrets you need to set. They are invisible to anyone including you once they are set, for security.

| Key |Description | Example |
| :---  | :---  | :--- |
| ZOTERO_ID  | User ID of your Zotero account. **User ID is not your username, but a sequence of numbers**Get your ID from [here](https://www.zotero.org/settings/security). You can find it at the position shown in this [screenshot](https://github.com/TideDra/zotero-arxiv-daily/blob/main/assets/userid.png). | 12345678  |
| ZOTERO_KEY | An Zotero API key with read access. Get a key from [here](https://www.zotero.org/settings/security).  | AB5tZ877P2j7Sm2Mragq041H   |
| SENDER | The email account of the SMTP server that sends you email. | abc@qq.com |
| SENDER_PASSWORD | The password of the sender account. Note that it's not necessarily the password for logging in the e-mail client, but the authentication code for SMTP service. Ask your email provider for this.   | abcdefghijklmn |
| RECEIVER | The e-mail address that receives the paper list. | abc@outlook.com |
| OPENAI_API_KEY | API Key when using the API to access LLMs. You can get FREE API for using advanced open source LLMs in [SiliconFlow](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/b3XhBRAm). | sk-xxx |
| OPENAI_API_BASE | API URL when using the API to access LLMs. | https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1 |

Then you should also set a public variable `CUSTOM_CONFIG` for your custom configuration.
![vars](./assets/repo_var.png)
![custom_config](./assets/config_var.png)
Paste the following content into the value of `CUSTOM_CONFIG` variable:
```yaml
zotero:
  user_id: ${oc.env:ZOTERO_ID}
  api_key: ${oc.env:ZOTERO_KEY}
  include_path: null # Or e.g. ["2026/survey/**", "2026/reading-group/**"]

  reranker: local # The reranker to use. Example: 'local' or 'api'
```

To enable an additional LLM reading-priority pass, set `reranker.prompt` in `CUSTOM_CONFIG` to a multiline description of your interests. It reuses `llm` and promotes up to 20 papers from the embedding-selected `executor.max_paper_num` candidates; the remaining papers keep their embedding order. Email and Zotero use the same final order. `Relevance` remains the original embedding score, not an LLM score. Empty prompts or failed/invalid responses preserve the embedding order.

For example, a systems researcher can request both directly relevant systems work and new AI architectures or modules that suggest future changes in memory access, communication, scheduling, or hardware needs. The prompt can express different priorities for deep reading and a quick look at a method. It only affects papers already in the candidate pool; it does not broaden the subscribed sources or recover papers outside the shortlist.

That's all! Now you can test the workflow by manually triggering it:
![test](./assets/test.png)

> [!NOTE]
> The Test-Workflow Action is the debug version of the main workflow (Send-emails-daily), which always retrieve 5 arxiv papers regardless of the date. While the main workflow will be automatically triggered everyday and retrieve new papers released yesterday. There is no new arxiv paper at weekends and holiday, in which case you may see "No new papers found" in the log of main workflow.

Then check the log and the receiver email after it finishes.

By default, the main workflow runs on 22:00 UTC everyday. You can change this time by editting the workflow config `.github/workflows/main.yml`.

### Local Running
Supported by [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), this workflow can easily run on your local device if uv is installed:
```bash
# set all the environment variables
# export ZOTERO_ID=xxxx
# ...
cd zotero-arxiv-daily
uv run main.py
```

## 📖 How it works
*Zotero-arXiv-Daily* firstly retrieves all the papers in your Zotero library and all the papers released in the previous day, via corresponding API. Then it calculates the embedding of each paper's abstract via an embedding model. The score of a paper is its weighted average similarity over all your Zotero papers (newer paper added to the library has higher weight). For each paper in the email list, the LLM translates the complete abstract into the configured language. Detailed illustrated reports are generated separately for the papers selected for Zotero.

## 📌 Limitations
- The recommendation algorithm is very simple, it may not accurately reflect your interest. Welcome better ideas for improving the algorithm!
- High `MAX_PAPER_NUM` can lead the execution time exceed the limitation of Github Action runner (6h per execution for public repo, and 2000 mins per month for private repo). Commonly, the quota given to public repo is definitely enough for individual use. If you have special requirements, you can deploy the workflow in your own server, or use a self-hosted Github Action runner, or pay for the exceeded execution time.

### Self-hosted reader additions (fork)

This fork keeps upstream retrieval, embedding ranking and email delivery. Its
small executor hooks add optional preference-based LLM reranking, complete abstract
translation, and local outputs consumed by Research Radar. Each paper uses one
LLM request for abstract translation and affiliations, with five papers processed
concurrently. The complete abstract is preserved; only the paper beginning for
affiliation extraction is limited to 2,000 estimated tokens. Failed requests keep
the original abstract without stopping other papers. `reranker.prompt` is
optional; personal preferences belong in the deployment configuration.

The existing `zotero.save_top_k` (default 10) also selects illustrated reports.
Reports run with five workers after email delivery, reuse the existing LLM
configuration, and use the prompt in
[`report_prompt.txt`](src/zotero_arxiv_daily/report_prompt.txt).
Local runs require OpenCode on PATH. Reports are saved locally and never uploaded
to Zotero or WebDAV. `zotero.save_collection` independently controls metadata-only
Zotero sync. Existing library items and user notes remain untouched.

Local output contracts:

- `outputs/paper-index.json`: public candidates, recommendation order and translated
  abstracts; no credentials or private interest corpus.
- `outputs/report-results.json`: report status and local HTML path keyed by paper
  URL, independent of Zotero. Failed reports do not stop other reports; nonempty
  reports in the same output directory are reused on retry.
- `outputs/zotero-results.json`: metadata sync receipts only.

`DAILYARXIV_DRY_RUN=1` exports the reading index and skips email, Zotero writes and
report generation. The self-hosted platform owns scheduling; the fork's email
Actions workflows are manual-only to avoid duplicate delivery.
